Applications at startup
-----------------------

Upon startup, sagarmatha-session starts the following applications:
 - Saved session: if you have saved a session, it is located in 
   ~/.config/sagarmatha-session/saved-session/. You can enable automatic 
   session saving or manually save it in the "Startup Applications" 
   configuration applet.
 - Autostart applications: applications shipping a .desktop file in 
   /usr/share/gnome/autostart or /etc/xdg/autostart. This includes the 
   keyring manager, the settings daemon, nautilus and the power 
   manager. They can be selectively disabled in the configuration 
   applet.
 - Required components: they are listed in the 
   /usr/share/sagarmatha-session/sessions/*.desktop file corresponding to the 
   current session (gnome or gnome-fallback).
